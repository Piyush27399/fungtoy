					<h2>How We Met</h2>
					<p>
						Brandon and Kristie started working together in the Finance Department at Rocketdyne in 2007. What started out as group co-worker lunches and a mutual dislike of work quickly developed into a close friendship once they realized they shared more than those two common interests. One likeness that caught both their attention was their music libraries - meticulously organized by period, genre, artist, and album. Kristie's heart went pitter-patter at the sight of Brandon's five page list of music she loved.
					</p>
					<p>
						Brandon moved to West LA three years later, just blocks away from Kristie's apartment. Since she had stopped her own cable subscription, Kristie promptly invited herself over to watch Mad Men every Sunday night. After weeks of "just hanging out" together, Brandon started catching onto Kristie's ploy. Not only did his TV bill grow, but his affection for her did as well. Awww!

					<h2>The Engagement</h2>
					<p>Friday the 13th, December 2013:</p>
					<p>I came home from a girl's night out and Brandon suggested exchanging Christmas presents early because I was headed home to Daly City to spend Christmas with my family. [your line here, e.g. i just came home from my work Christmas party and thought about proposing.. iono something like that]</p>
					<p>As soon as he suggested it, I started running around the house searching every room for my present. [your line here]</p>
					<p>He finally made me sit on the couch and told me not to move. I sat impatiently waiting... until he brought a HUGE box from the back room.  [your line here]</p>
					<p>He was having trouble dragging the box out -- and for some reason, I got it in my head that the gift was a puppy!  [your line here]</p>
					<p>While he dragged the box, he accidentally kicked it and I thought, "Oh my god, a puppy!!! Wait -- oh my god, I'm not ready for a puppy! I'm leaving in a couple days! It's going to tear the house apart!" [your line here]</p>
					<p>After two minutes of cajoling, I finally opened the box. [your line here]</p>
					<p>- and when I looked inside, it was completely empty save for a small card at the very bottom. After struggling to reach in and pull the card out, and reading his sweet message, I swung around to look at him and he was on one knee, ring in hand!  [your line here]</p>
					<p>I immediately freaked out and ran away to hide behind the couch. [your line here]</p>
					<p>All the while, he was reciting the sweetest proposal. [your line here]</p>
					<p>After five minutes of coaxing me back over to him, he asked me again if I would marry him and in between laughs, giggles, and shock, I said "yes! yes ok yes!"</p>

					<h2>The Bride</h2>
					<p>Kristie is a combination of sweet, sassy, smart, and sensible. If she's not laughing, she's usually busy talking. She loves to bake, read, and travel.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>The Groom</h2>
					<p>Five things I love about my soon-to-be-husband:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>He's witty: he sends me into fits of giggles and stomach-rolling with his deadpan comments and jokes that come out of nowhere.</li>
						<li>He's intelligent: high test scores, elite schools, and big brain aside, he helps me learn and makes me want to learn more about all things, big and small.</li>
						<li>He's inquisitive: want to know about highways? He can tell you all about them and the different types of exits. Want to know about a ROTH IRA? He's knows the percentages and best ROI's. Want to know about the Die Hard series? He'll recite all four movies line for line.</li>
						<li>He loves Batman: he secretly wishes he could be Batman, minus the Bruce Wayne issues.</li>
						<li>He's a John Wayne fanatic: what Asian guy under 40 do you know that loves cowboys? It's completely endearing.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>The Bride's Party</h2>
					<h4>Jennifer Wong, Maid of Honor</h4>
					<p>My BFF, my sister, and first love-of-my-life, since the day she yanked on my hair in our high school religion class. There isn't a rock we haven't overturned together or lands unknown that we aren't willing to trek with one another. I admire her willingness to learn, love, question, and speak her mind. She's been a constant friend, confidant, and accomplice; and I can't wait to share every new step with her.</p>
					<h4>Emily Chen, Bridesmaid</h4>
					<p>Past-roommate, "ex-wife", and Wedding-Creative-Director-Extraordinaire, Emily has been the Bella to my Edward, the Gabriella to my Troy. She is my rock through hard times and my advisor on all else; we will forever be classified in the Young Adult book section together.</p>
					<h4>Kalista Wong, Bridesmaid</h4>
					<p>Always sweet-tempered, sincere, and gracious, Kali has continued to be the Dora to my Diego. When we're not exploring new places like Korea or Macau, we're probably  eating our way through LA and SF!  Physically, we're the same size; mentally, we have the same mindset and interests - we're just like twins!</p>

					<h2>The Groom's Party</h2>
					<h4>Jon Ang, Best Man</h4>
					<p>Jon and I spent six months in Connecticut together on a Finance Rotational Program with Pratt & Whitney. Through our mutual loathing of work, snow, and being in the middle of nowhere, we've grown closer as friends and I'm honored to have him as my Best Man.</p>
					<h4>Steven Fung, Groomsman</h4>
					<p>Through our love for all things military, airplanes, books, and robots, Steve and I have become good friends. [insert something witty here] I'm looking forward to calling him my brother-in-law.</p>
